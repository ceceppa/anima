# Anima pluging for Godot 4

This is the ready-to-be-installed [Anima](https://github.com/ceceppa/anima) addon for Godot4.

## NOTE

**The plugin is still in development and not all the feature works fine on Godot4.**

This repository contains only the **addon** code without the demo and documentation and has been created to allow users to install the addon via the AssetLibrary.

The development happens on the [godot-4](https://github.com/ceceppa/anima/tree/godot-4) branch of the main [anima repository](https://github.com/ceceppa/anima/). So, any issue or pull request needs to be open there.

## Documentation

WIP documentation is available [here](https://anima.ceceppa.me/docs/)
